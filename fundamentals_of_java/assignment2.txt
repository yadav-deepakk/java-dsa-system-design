Q1: What is statically and Dynamically typed Prorgamming language?
A1: In some programming laguages we have to specify which type of data we are going to store into variables
    before compile time, these programming languages are called statically typed programming language. 
    Programming language in which we do not have to specify which type of data we are going to store into 
    variables. They are capable to changing the data type as the value of variable changes during program 
    execution. Such programming languages are known as dynamically typed programming language. 


Q2: What is the variable in java?
A2: Variable is a name(identifier) given to a memory location which can be used to store any specific type of 
    data(information). This memory location is going to be used by programmer during the program execution in 
    order to perform some operation and store value. 


Q3: How to assign a value To variable?
A3: We can create a variable then assign value to variables using assignment operator. some examples are 
    given below.
    eg.
    1) int x; 
       x = 100; 
    2) float f1 = 10.23f;
    3) long l1 = 132312345fL;


Q4: What are primitive data types in java?
A4: In any programming languge have to offer some build-in data types which can be used directly in our programs 
    they are known as Prmitive data types. These data types are mainly integral data types(floating point and 
    integers) and boolean and character. 
    1) Integral types: they are devided into 2 category based on integer values they store. 
    - To store integer values:
        (i) byte:
            used to store integer values from -128 to 127 range. 
            byte data type's size is 1 byte(8 bits).
        (ii) short:
            used to store integer values from -2^15 to -2^15 -1.
            short data type's size is 2 bytes (15 bits).
        (iii) int: 
            used to store integer values from -2^31 to -2^31 -1.
            int data type's size is 4 bytes (32 bits).
        (iv) long: 
            this data type is used to store very large integer values ranging from -2^63 to 2^63 -1.
            long data type's size is 8 bytes (64 bits).

    - To store real values(floating point numbers)
        (i) float: 
            float is used to store floating numbers. float is used to store small values with low precision. 
            size is 8 bytes(32 bits). 

        (ii) double: 
            double is used to store floating numbers but has double in size. double is used to store larger values 
            with high precision. 
            size is 8 bytes(64 bits). 
 
    2) Boolean(boolean): it can store only 2 literals(values). Either 'true' or 'false'. 
    3) Character(char): This data type is used to store ASCII characters. size is 4 bytes. 


Q5: What are the identifiers in java?
A5: Any name given to package, class, object or variables in java are known as identifiers. There are some rules
    (restrictions) to create java idenfieres. 
    (1) Java idenfieres must only contains letters(uppercase and lower case) and numbers. No other characters are
    allowed. Apart from above, Only 2 special characters are allowed in java are '$' and '_'.
    (2) Any identifier should not start with a number. 
    (3) Java identifiers can be of any length, there is no special restriction but it is adviced to use sensible
    names in java identifiers.
    (4) method names and variable names are adviced to be written in camel case. class names are written in pascal
    case. 


Q6: List the operators in java?
A6: Operators are used in java to perform some mathematical and logical operations. There are following types of 
    operators in java:
    1) Arithmetic operators
    2) Assignment operator
    3) Logical operators
    4) Unary operators
    5) Relational oprators
    6) Conditional/Ternary Operator
    7) Bitwise operators


Q7: Explain about inrement and decrement operators and give an example?
A7: Increament/Decrement(++/--) operators are operator which are applied on single operands. There are two types 
    of increaments - preincrement(++op) and postincrement(op++), similarly There are two types of decreaments - 
    predecrement(--op) and postdecrement(op--). In Pre(Increament/Decrement) first operation of increament or 
    decreament is applied then whatever value is generated will be used in expression. Whereas in case of post
    (increament/decreament) first operand value of oprand is used in the expression then the operation of pre - 
    (increament/decreament) is applied. 

    eg. 
    int x, y, z;
    x = 10;     // x=10, 
    y = ++x;    // y=11 and x=11 (x is first increamented as it is a preincreament operation)
    z = y--;    // z=11 and y=10 (y is first used in expression later decreamented by value 1)

    System.out.println("x=" + x + " y="+ y + " z=" + z);
    // output will be -> x=11 y=10 z=11
